# Securing Your Somun Server

Ensuring the security of your Somun Server installation is essential to protect your data and maintain the integrity of your multiplayer games. This guide provides a basic overview of the steps needed to secure your Somun Server installation.

## 1. **Update and Patch Regularly**
Keep your server and all its components up-to-date. Regularly apply security patches and updates to the operating system, Somun Server, and all dependencies.

### Steps:
- Use package managers like `apt` or `yum` to update your OS.
- Regularly check the Somun Server [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deniza/somun-server) for updates and apply them.
- Subscribe to security mailing lists for your OS and software stack.

## 2. **Secure Network Configuration**

### a. **Firewall Configuration**
Use a firewall to restrict access to necessary ports only.

#### Recommended Configuration:
- Allow incoming traffic on the port Somun Server is listening on (default is 443 for HTTPS).
- Deny all other inbound connections unless explicitly required.
- Secure the admin interface (if enabled) on port 8080 by restricting access to trusted IP addresses only.
- Use tools like `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) or `iptables` on Linux.

Example using `ufw`:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow from <trusted-ip> to any port 8080
sudo ufw deny 8080
sudo ufw enable
```

### b. **SSH Security**
- Disable root login via SSH.
- Use key-based authentication instead of passwords.
- Change the default SSH port.

Example SSH configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`):
```plaintext
Port 2222
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
```

## 3. **Secure Socket Layer (SSL/TLS)**
Ensure that all communications with the server are encrypted.

### Steps:
- Obtain a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
- Use Certbot for free SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.

Example using Certbot:
```bash
sudo apt-get install certbot
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
```

- Configure your web server (Nginx or Apache) to use the SSL certificate.

Example Nginx configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;
    
    # Additional security headers
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
}
```

## 4. **Database Security**

### MongoDB Security:
- Enable authentication.
- Use strong passwords for database users.
- Restrict network access to the database.

Example MongoDB configuration (`/etc/mongod.conf`):
```yaml
security:
  authorization: enabled

net:
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1
```

### Steps to create a MongoDB user:
```js
use admin
db.createUser(
  {
    user: "adminUser",
    pwd: "securePassword",
    roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
  }
)
```

## 5. **Somun Admin Interface Security**

### a. **Firewall Configuration**
The admin interface, if enabled, listens on port 8080 and is not password protected. It must be secured using a firewall to restrict access to trusted IP addresses only.

Example using `ufw`:
```bash
sudo ufw allow from <trusted-ip> to any port 8080
sudo ufw deny 8080
```

## 6. **Monitoring and Logging**
Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.

### Steps:
- Use tools like Fail2Ban to block IPs after multiple failed login attempts.
- Regularly review logs for suspicious activity.

Example Fail2Ban configuration:
```ini
[sshd]
enabled  = true
port     = 2222
logpath  = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 5
```

## 7. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**
Regularly back up your data and have a disaster recovery plan in place.

### Steps:
- Automate backups using cron jobs.
- Store backups securely, preferably off-site.

Example cron job for MongoDB backup:
```bash
0 2 * * * /usr/bin/mongodump --out /var/backups/mongodump-$(date +\%F) --gzip
```

## 8. **User Education and Policies**
Educate your users and administrators on security best practices.

### Recommendations:
- Enforce strong password policies.
- Conduct regular security training sessions.
- Establish and enforce security policies.

## 9. **Underlying Infrastructure Security**
Securing the underlying infrastructure (i.e., operating system and basic services) is not an easy task and requires deep knowledge and expertise. Consider consulting with or hiring security professionals to ensure your server's infrastructure is robustly protected.

### Recommendations:
- Conduct regular security audits.
- Use hardened images and configurations.
- Implement network segmentation to limit access.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your Somun Server installation. Regularly review and update your security practices to stay ahead of potential threats.
